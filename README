scons-chicken
=============

scons-chicken is an add-on for SCons (http://www.scons.org), a building system (much like make and autotools, all in one), that adds support for Chicken (http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/), a Scheme-to-C compiler.

Installation
------------
To install it you'll need SCons (http://www.scons.org) and all you need is to run:
 scons install
and it will install chicken.py on /usr/lib/scons/Scons/Tool/. If you installed SCons somewhere else, edit SConstruct and fix.
If you know of a better fix that will work no matter where you installed SCons (that is, something that will automatically find out where to place chicken.py), then, please, tell me about it (pupeno@pupeno.com).

Usage
-----
To learn how to use scons-chicken, check out the examples directories.
sc-sap: scons-chicken stand-alone-program (doesn't depend on any library).
sc-ofl: scons-chicken one-file-library.
sc-mfl: scons-chicken multiple-file-library (depends on sc-ofl).
sc-ofp: scons-chicken one-file-program.
sc-mfp: scons-chicken multiple-file-program (depends on sc-tfl).
sc-lap: scons-chicken library-and-file (it is a mix of ofl and ofp).

Limitations
-----------
It can't create extensions of multiple libraries (but it can create libraries of multiple files).
