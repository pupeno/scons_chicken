SCons-Gambit
============

SCons-Gambit is an add-on for SCons (http://www.scons.org), a building system (much like make and autotools, all in one), that adds support for Gambit (http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/), a Scheme-to-C compiler.
To learn how to use SCons-Gambit, check out the examples directories. The modules there are the ones in Gambit's manual, but automatized by SCons.
